In this project we used deep supervised learning to drive a race car autonomously on physical tracks with different difficulty level and background. We used Tamiya TT02 car model which has independent steering and acceleration control. This vehicle is operated on DC battery and has independent servo motors for lateral and longitudinal control. Steering motor’s rotation is limited to certain angle with turning radius of 15’’ to the vehicle whereas throttle motor rotates fully clockwise as well as anticlockwise direction for breaking and forward movement. This setup is further modified by integrating a GPU computer i.e. NVIDIA Jetson Nano, Telemetry transmitter & receiver, multiplexer, WIFI card with antenna and PWM servo motor driver.

We trained two networks (lateral and longitudinal control model) on three different tracks i.e. easy reflective track, easy non-reflective track and hard non-reflective track. We used CNN network similar to the [NVIDIA Research paper](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf) in which they used three cameras in three different directions whereas here we only used one front facing camera. The network we used has five convolutional layers, one normalisation layer, two Maxpool layers, one dropout and five linear layers with total of 2970 thousand parameters. Full convolutional neural network for both acceleration and steering is shown in Figure below. For regularization we used dropouts after the CNN layers and maxpool layer after first and second convolutional layer. To allow network to learn the optimal parameters more quickly we used normalization layer as our first layer. For training we used a remote computer with 6 GB GPU capability and Pytorch for faster and optimized training. While deployment on hard track it was observed that, due to interference in the centre R17’’ curve vehicle sometimes crosses the track diagonally and start running in the opposite direction.
